## Our Method's Advantages

Our **method** has the following three advantages:

1. **No annotations** required.
2. It has been evaluated on a multi-center dataset with over 1k cases, achieving Dice scores greater than 80% for tumor labels.
3. In addition to tumor labels, it can also generate coarse segmentation outputs for multiple categories, such as nipple labels, epidermis labels, fat labels, and gland labels, as shown in the GIF.
